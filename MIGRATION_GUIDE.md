# 🔄 **Corpus Migration Solution**

## 🎯 **The Problem:**
- ✅ **Local corpus** (`corpus_local.json`) has Atty. Philip Ray L. Nangkil's data
- ❌ **API/Redis corpus** doesn't have this data (built from wrong URLs)
- 🚀 **Deployed API** uses Redis, not local files

## 💡 **The Solution: Migration**

Transfer the working local corpus data to Redis so the API can access it.

## 🔧 **Migration Options:**

### **Option 1: API Endpoint (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start your API first
python main_basic.py

# Then migrate via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/migrate-corpus
```

### **Option 2: Direct Script**
```bash
# Requires Redis running locally
python migrate_corpus.py
```

## 📊 **What Gets Migrated:**

From `corpus_local.json` (338 documents) containing:
- ✅ **Atty. Philip Ray L. Nangkil** (Broker, 5 stars, 127 reviews)
- ✅ **Contact info:** 0917-843-9696, philipray96@gmail.com
- ✅ **Location:** 8 BOSS Hub, Peneyra Road, San Pedro, Puerto Princesa City
- ✅ **Specialties:** Luxury Homes, First-Time Buyers
- ✅ **Stats:** 8 years experience, 24 active listings, 156 total sales

## 🧪 **Test After Migration:**

```json
{
  "question": "Tell me about Atty. Philip Ray L. Nangkil",
  "user_id": "test"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "answer": "Atty. Philip Ray L. Nangkil is a broker with 5 stars and 127 reviews. He's located at 8 BOSS Hub, Peneyra Road, San Pedro, Puerto Princesa City. You can reach him at 0917-843-9696 or philipray96@gmail.com. He specializes in luxury homes and first-time buyers, with 8 years of experience, 24 active listings, and 156 total sales.",

}
```

## 🎉 **After Migration:**

- ✅ API will know about Atty. Philip Ray L. Nangkil
- ✅ All local corpus data available via API
- ✅ Deployed version will have complete information
- ✅ No more "I don't see any mention" responses

## 🚀 **For Production:**

When you deploy, make sure to run the migration endpoint once to populate Redis with your local corpus data!
