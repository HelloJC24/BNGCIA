# 🤖 **Conversational AI Improvements**

## ✅ **What Changed:**

### **Before (Too Strict):**
```
"Based on the following context, answer the question. If the answer is not in the context, say so."
```
**Result:** Even greetings got "The answer is not in the context" 😞

### **After (Smart & Natural):**
```
🎯 Detects greetings automatically
🎯 Different prompts for greetings vs information requests  
🎯 Natural conversational responses
🎯 Graceful handling of unknown information
```

## 🧠 **How It Works:**

### **1. Greeting Detection**
```python
greeting_words = ['hello', 'hi', 'hey', 'good morning', 'how are you', ...]
is_greeting = any(greeting in question_lower for greeting in greeting_words)
```

### **2. Smart Prompt Selection**

#### **For Greetings:**
```
"Respond naturally to their greeting and introduce yourself as the company's AI assistant..."
```

#### **For Information Requests:**
```
"Use the provided context to answer questions... If specific info isn't available, redirect to what you do know..."
```

## 🎯 **Expected Responses Now:**

| Input | Before | After |
|-------|--------|--------|
| "Hello!" | ❌ "Not in context" | ✅ "Hi! I'm your company AI assistant..." |
| "How are you?" | ❌ "Not in context" | ✅ "I'm doing great! How can I help..." |
| "What services?" | ✅ Uses context | ✅ Uses context (same) |
| "Do you sell unicorns?" | ❌ "Not in context" | ✅ "I don't have that info, but here's what we do offer..." |

## 🧪 **Test Commands:**

```bash
# Test greetings
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Hello!", "user_id": "test"}'

# Test company questions  
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What services do you offer?", "user_id": "test"}'
```

## 🎉 **Result:**

**Now your AI assistant feels human and conversational while still being factual!** 🤖💬

Your "Hello?" should now get a proper greeting response instead of "not in context"!
